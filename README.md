# Currency Converter

## Description

This currency converter project allows users to convert between multiple currencies. The application includes a header displaying the current exchange rates for USD and EUR relative to UAH. 

## Features

- **Header**: Displays the current exchange rates for USD and EUR relative to UAH. 
- **Conversion Component**:
  - Separate input and select elements for each currency.
  - Input fields allow users to specify the amount to convert.
  - Select elements to provide options for the required currency.
  - Conversion is bidirectional, meaning that changing the value in one currency updates the value in the other and vice versa.
  - Changing the currency in the select elements recalculates the conversion values correctly.
